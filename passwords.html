            <p>
                Passwords are often the only barrier between your private information and
                cybercriminals. Yet most students don't take password security seriously
                enough, putting their academic work, financial accounts, and personal data
                at risk.

            <h3>Common Password Mistakes Students Make</h3>

            <p>
                Understanding what makes a password weak helps you avoid these pitfalls:
            </p>

            <ol>
                <li>
                    <strong>Using personal information</strong> - Birthdays, pet names,
                    partner names, and university names are easy to guess. Attackers check
                    social media for this information first.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Passwords shorter than 12 characters</strong> - Modern computers
                    can crack 8-character passwords in hours. Length matters more than
                    complexity.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Reusing passwords across accounts</strong> - If one service is
                    breached, all your accounts with the same password are compromised.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Sharing passwords with friends</strong> - Relationships change,
                    and shared passwords often aren't changed afterward.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Writing passwords on sticky notes</strong> - Physical security
                    matters too. Anyone walking past your desk can see your passwords.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Using common passwords</strong> - "123456", "password",
                    "qwerty", and "student" are in every attacker's dictionary.
                </li>
            </ol>

            <div class="warning-box">
                <h4>The Danger of Password Reuse</h4>
                <p>
                    When you use the same password for multiple accounts, one data breach
                    exposes all of them. Criminals use "credential stuffing" - automatically
                    trying stolen username/password combinations on hundreds of popular
                    services.

        <section>
            <h3>Creating Strong Passwords</h3>

            <p>
                The best passwords are both strong (hard to crack) and memorable (so you
                don't need to write them down). Here are proven methods:
            </p>

            <h4>Method 1: Three Random Words (NCSC Recommended)</h4>
            <p>
                The UK National Cyber Security Centre recommends combining three random,
                unrelated words. This creates passwords that are:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Long enough to resist cracking (12+ characters)</li>
                <li>Memorable without writing down</li>
                <li>Unique to each account (add a service hint)</li>
            </ul>

            <div class="info-box">
                <h4>Example: Three Random Words</h4>
                <p>
                    <strong>purple-giraffe-telescope</strong> - 26 characters, memorable,
                    and would take centuries to crack with current technology.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For different accounts, add a hint: <strong>purple-giraffe-telescope-UNI</strong>
                    for university, <strong>purple-giraffe-telescope-BANK</strong> for banking.
                </p>
            </div>

            <h4>Method 2: Passphrase from a Sentence</h4>
            <p>
                Create a memorable sentence and use the first letters of each word,
                mixing in numbers and symbols.
            </p>

            <div class="info-box">
                <h4>Example: Passphrase Creation</h4>
                <p>
                    Sentence: "I started university in 2024 and my favourite class is Web Design!"
                </p>
                <p>
                    Password: <strong>Isui2024&mfciWD!</strong> - 16 characters, includes
                    uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and symbols.
                </p>
            </div>

            <h4>What Makes a Password Strong?</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Length:</strong> 12+ characters minimum (16+ is better)</li>
                <li><strong>Uniqueness:</strong> Different for every account</li>
                <li><strong>Unpredictability:</strong> Not based on personal information</li>
                <li><strong>No dictionary words:</strong> As single elements (random combinations are fine)</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <!-- Password managers -->
        <section>
            <h3>Password Managers: Your Digital Vault</h3>

            <p>
                A password manager is software that generates, stores, and fills in unique
                passwords for all your accounts. You only need to remember one master
                password.
            </p>

            <h4>Benefits of Password Managers</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>Generate strong passwords</strong> - Creates random, complex
                    passwords for each account automatically
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Remember everything</strong> - Securely stores unlimited
                    passwords so you don't have to memorize them
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Auto-fill forms</strong> - Enters credentials automatically,
                    saving time and preventing typos
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Detect phishing</strong> - Won't auto-fill on fake websites
                    because the URL doesn't match
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Sync across devices</strong> - Access passwords on your phone,
                    laptop, and tablet
                </li>
            </ul>

                <p>
                    Install a password manager, create a strong master password using the
                    methods above, then gradually add your accounts. Most browsers offer
                    to import saved passwords, making migration simple.

        <section>
            <h3>Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)</h3>

            <p>
                Two-factor authentication adds a second layer of security beyond your
                password. Even if an attacker steals your password, they can't access
                your account without the second factor.
            </p>

            </div>

            <h4>Types of 2FA</h4>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    <strong>Authenticator apps (recommended)</strong> - Apps like Google
                    Authenticator or Authy generate time-based codes on your phone.
                    Most secure common option.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>SMS codes</strong> - Text message codes sent to your phone.
                    Better than nothing, but can be intercepted via SIM swapping.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Hardware keys</strong> - Physical devices like YubiKey.
                    Most secure, but requires purchasing hardware.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Biometrics</strong> - Fingerprint or face recognition.
                    Convenient but depends on device security.
                </li>
            </ol>

            <h4>Where to Enable 2FA First</h4>
            <p>Prioritize these accounts for immediate 2FA protection:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>University email and student portal</li>
                <li>Primary personal email (Gmail, Outlook, etc.)</li>
                <li>Banking and financial accounts</li>
                <li>Social media (especially if linked to other accounts)</li>
                <li>Cloud storage (Google Drive, Dropbox, OneDrive)</li>
            </ul>

            <div class="warning-box">
                <h4>Save Your Backup Codes!</h4>
                <p>
                    When you enable 2FA, most services provide backup codes. Save these
                    somewhere secure (like your password manager) - they're your only way
                    back into your account if you lose your phone.
