            <h3>The Hidden Dangers of Free Wi-Fi</h3>

            <p>
                University campuses offer free Wi-Fi everywhere - libraries, cafes, lecture
                halls, and dormitories. While convenient, these networks often lack proper
                security, making them hunting grounds for cybercriminals looking to intercept
                your data.
            </p>

            <div class="warning-box">
                <h4>Public Wi-Fi = Public Risk</h4>
                <p>
                    When you connect to public Wi-Fi, you're sharing a network with everyone
                    else connected. Without proper encryption, attackers on the same network
                    can potentially see your traffic, including passwords and personal
                    information.

            <h3>Common Attacks on Public Wi-Fi</h3>

            <p>
                Cybercriminals use several techniques to exploit public network vulnerabilities:

                <article>
                    <h4>Man-in-the-Middle (MITM)</h4>
                    <p>
                        Attackers intercept communications between your device and the
                        router, allowing them to eavesdrop on your traffic, steal login
                        credentials, and inject malicious content.
                    </p>
                </article>

                <article>
                    <h4>Evil Twin Networks</h4>
                    <p>
                        Attackers create fake Wi-Fi hotspots with names like "University_WiFi_Free"
                        that look legitimate. When you connect, all your traffic flows
                        through their device.

                <article>
                    <h4>Packet Sniffing</h4>
                    <p>
                        Using freely available software, attackers capture and analyze
                        network packets to extract unencrypted data like emails, messages,
                        and login information.

                </article>

                <article>
                    <h4>Session Hijacking</h4>
                    <p>
                        Attackers steal your session cookies to take over your logged-in
                        accounts on websites, gaining access without needing your password.

            <h3>High-Risk Locations on Campus</h3>

            <p>
                Be especially cautious when using Wi-Fi in these common student locations:
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>University Libraries</strong> - High traffic, open networks,
                    and extended sessions make libraries prime targets for attackers
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Campus Cafes and Food Courts</strong> - Casual environments
                    where people let their guard down while checking emails or banking
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Student Accommodation/Dorms</strong> - Shared networks with
                    many unknown users, often with weak security configurations
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Lecture Halls and Study Spaces</strong> - Large numbers of
                    connected devices create opportunities for network-based attacks
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Off-Campus Coffee Shops</strong> - Often have no security
                    at all, with anyone able to connect and monitor traffic
                </li>
            </ul>

            <div class="info-box">
                <h4>Remember: "Secure" Doesn't Mean Safe</h4>
                <p>
                    Even if a Wi-Fi network requires a password to connect, this only
                    controls who can join the network. It doesn't prevent other connected
                    users from attempting to intercept your traffic.
                </p>
            </div>
        </section>

        <!-- VPNs -->
        <section>
            <h3>VPNs: Your Shield on Public Networks</h3>

            <p>
                A Virtual Private Network (VPN) creates an encrypted tunnel between your
                device and a secure server. Even if someone intercepts your traffic, they
                can't read it.
            </p>

            <h4>How VPNs Protect You</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>Encryption</strong> - All data leaving your device is encrypted,
                    making it unreadable to attackers on the same network
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>IP Masking</strong> - Your real IP address is hidden, replaced
                    with the VPN server's address
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Secure Tunnel</strong> - Creates a protected pathway through
                    the public network to the VPN server
                </li>
            </ul>

                        Many universities provide free VPN access to students. Check
                        with your IT department - this is often the best option for
                        academic resources.

                <h4>Always Enable VPN on Public Wi-Fi</h4>
                <p>
                    Make it a habit: before you access any sensitive information (email,
                    banking, social media) on public Wi-Fi, turn on your VPN first.
                    It takes seconds and significantly increases your security.

            <h3>Staying Safe on Public Wi-Fi</h3>

            <p>
                Follow these practices to protect yourself on public networks:
            </p>

            <ol>
                <li>
                    <strong>Use a VPN</strong> - This is the single most effective
                    protection on public networks. Enable it before connecting.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Verify network names</strong> - Ask staff for the correct
                    Wi-Fi name before connecting. Attackers create similar-sounding
                    fake networks.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Look for HTTPS</strong> - Only enter sensitive information
                    on websites showing the padlock icon and "https://" in the address.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Disable auto-connect</strong> - Turn off automatic Wi-Fi
                    connection on your devices to avoid connecting to rogue networks.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Avoid sensitive activities</strong> - Don't access banking
                    or enter passwords on public Wi-Fi unless using a VPN.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Use mobile data for sensitive tasks</strong> - Your phone's
                    cellular connection is more secure than public Wi-Fi.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Enable firewall</strong> - Ensure your device's firewall is
                    active to block unauthorized connection attempts.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Forget networks after use</strong> - Remove saved public
                    networks so your device doesn't auto-connect later.
                </li>
            </ol>

        <!-- HTTPS -->
        <section>
            <h3>Understanding HTTPS</h3>

            <p>
                HTTPS (Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure) encrypts data between your
                browser and the website. Look for these indicators:
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>Padlock icon</strong> in the browser address bar
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>URL starts with "https://"</strong> (not just "http://")
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>No security warnings</strong> from your browser
                </li>
            </ul>

            <div class="warning-box">
                <h4>Never Enter Passwords on Non-HTTPS Sites</h4>
                <p>
                    If a login page doesn't use HTTPS, any credentials you enter can
                    be intercepted in plain text. Legitimate websites always use HTTPS
                    for login pages.
                </p>
            </div>

            <h4>Enable HTTPS-Only Mode</h4>
            <p>
                Modern browsers offer HTTPS-only mode, which blocks or warns about
                non-secure connections. Enable this in your browser settings:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Chrome:</strong> Settings > Privacy and Security > Security > Always use secure connections</li>
                <li><strong>Firefox:</strong> Settings > Privacy & Security > HTTPS-Only Mode</li>
