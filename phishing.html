            <h3>What is Phishing?</h3>

            <p>
                Phishing is a cyberattack where criminals send fraudulent messages designed
                to trick you into revealing sensitive information, such as passwords, credit
                card numbers, or personal data. These messages often impersonate trusted
                entities like your university, banks, or popular services.
            </p>

            <div class="warning-box">
                <h4>Students Are Prime Targets</h4>
                <p>
                    <strong>70% of university students</strong> are vulnerable to phishing
                    attacks. Scammers know students manage multiple accounts, face financial
                    pressures, and may be less experienced in identifying fraud.

            <h3>How Phishing Attacks Work</h3>

            <p>
                Understanding the anatomy of a phishing attack helps you identify them.
                Here's the typical process:
            </p>

            <ol>
                <li>
                    <strong>The Setup:</strong> Attackers create convincing fake emails
                    or websites that mimic legitimate organizations. They may use similar
                    logos, language, and email addresses.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>The Bait:</strong> They send messages with urgent requests
                    or enticing offers. Common triggers include "your account will be
                    suspended" or "claim your refund now."
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>The Hook:</strong> A link in the message leads to a fake
                    website that looks authentic. When you enter your credentials, they're
                    captured by the attackers.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>The Exploitation:</strong> Attackers use your stolen credentials
                    to access your accounts, steal data, commit identity fraud, or launch
                    attacks on others using your compromised account.
                </li>
            </ol>

            <div class="info-box">
                <h4>Spear Phishing: Targeted Attacks</h4>
                <p>
                    Unlike mass phishing, spear phishing targets specific individuals using
                    personal information gathered from social media or data breaches. An
                    attacker might reference your course, professor's name, or recent
                    campus events to appear legitimate.

            <h3>Warning Signs of Phishing</h3>

            <p>
                Learn to spot these red flags that indicate a message may be a phishing attempt:
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>Generic greetings</strong> like "Dear Student" or "Dear User"
                    instead of your actual name
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Urgent or threatening language</strong> pressuring you to
                    "act immediately" or face consequences
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Suspicious sender addresses</strong> that don't match the
                    organization (e.g., university-support@gmail.com instead of
                    support@university.edu)
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Mismatched or suspicious links</strong> - hover over links
                    to see the actual URL before clicking
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Spelling and grammar errors</strong> that a legitimate
                    organization wouldn't make
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Unexpected attachments</strong> especially .exe, .zip, or
                    macro-enabled documents
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Requests for sensitive information</strong> like passwords,
                    PINs, or full credit card numbers via email
                </li>
            </ul>

            <div class="warning-box">
                <h4>Remember: Legitimate Organizations Never Ask For Passwords Via Email</h4>
                <p>
                    Your university IT department, bank, or any reputable service will
                    never email you asking for your password. If you receive such a
                    request, it's a phishing attempt.

            <h3>Protection Strategies</h3>

            <p>
                Follow these steps to protect yourself from phishing attacks:
            </p>

            <ol>
                <li>
                    <strong>Verify the sender</strong> - Check the email address carefully.
                    Look for subtle misspellings or unusual domains.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Don't click links in unexpected emails</strong> - Instead,
                    navigate directly to the website by typing the address in your browser.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Check URLs before entering credentials</strong> - Ensure you're
                    on the legitimate website (look for https:// and correct domain).
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Use two-factor authentication (2FA)</strong> - Even if your
                    password is stolen, 2FA prevents unauthorized access.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Report suspicious emails</strong> - Forward phishing attempts
                    to your university IT department so they can warn others.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Keep software updated</strong> - Browser and email updates
                    often include improved phishing detection.
                </li>
            </ol>

            <div class="success-box">
                <h4>When In Doubt, Verify Directly</h4>
                <p>
                    If you receive an unexpected request, contact the organization directly
                    using contact information from their official website - not from the
                    suspicious email. A quick phone call can confirm if the request is
                    legitimate.
