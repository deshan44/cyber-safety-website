        <!-- Overview -->
        <section>
            <h3>The Human Element of Hacking</h3>

            <p>
                Social engineering is the art of manipulating people into giving up
                confidential information or performing actions that compromise security.
                Rather than hacking computers, social engineers "hack" humans by exploiting
                trust, helpfulness, fear, and urgency.
            </p>

            <div class="warning-box">
                <h4>Why It Works</h4>
                <p>
                    Humans are naturally helpful and trusting. Social engineers exploit these
                    qualities by creating scenarios where it feels natural or urgent to comply
                    with their requests. Even security-aware people can be caught off guard.
                </p>

        <!-- Common tactics -->
        <section>
            <h3>Common Social Engineering Tactics</h3>

            <p>
                Attackers use various psychological techniques to manipulate their targets.
                Understanding these tactics helps you recognize when they're being used:
            </p>

            <div class="card-grid">
                <article>
                    <h4>Pretexting</h4>
                    <p>
                        Creating a fabricated scenario (pretext) to engage a victim. Example:
                        "Hi, I'm from IT and we need to verify your account due to a security
                        breach. Can you confirm your password?"
                    </p>
                </article>

                <article>
                    <h4>Baiting</h4>
                    <p>
                        Offering something enticing in exchange for information or action.
                        Example: "Free movie streaming if you download this app!" The app
                        contains malware or steals credentials.
                    </p>
                </article>

                <article>
                    <h4>Quid Pro Quo</h4>
                    <p>
                        Offering a service in exchange for information. Example: "I can help
                        fix your computer issues if you give me remote access." The attacker
                        then installs malware.
                    </p>
                </article>

                <article>
                    <h4>Tailgating</h4>
                    <p>
                        Following authorized personnel into secure areas. Example: Someone
                        carrying boxes asks you to hold the door to a restricted building
                        because their hands are full.
                    </p>

        <!-- Psychological triggers -->
        <section>
            <h3>Psychological Triggers Attackers Exploit</h3>

            <p>
                Social engineers manipulate specific psychological tendencies to make their
                attacks more effective:
            </p>

            <ol>
                <li>
                    <strong>Authority</strong> - We tend to comply with requests from people
                    in positions of power. Attackers impersonate professors, IT staff, or
                    administrators to leverage this tendency.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Urgency/Scarcity</strong> - Creating time pressure reduces our
                    ability to think critically. "Your account will be deleted in 24 hours!"
                    makes us act quickly without verifying.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Social Proof</strong> - We look to others for guidance. "Everyone
                    in your class has already submitted their password reset" implies you
                    should too.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Liking</strong> - We're more likely to comply with requests from
                    people we like. Attackers build rapport before making their request.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Reciprocity</strong> - We feel obligated to return favors. An
                    attacker might offer "help" first, then ask for sensitive information
                    in return.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Fear</strong> - Fear of consequences overrides rational thinking.
                    "Your scholarship will be cancelled unless you verify your information
                    immediately."
                </li>
            </ol>

            <div class="info-box">
                <h4>Recognize the Pattern</h4>
                <p>
                    When you feel pressured, rushed, or emotionally manipulated, pause and
                    consider whether someone might be using these tactics against you.
                    Legitimate requests don't rely on psychological manipulation.
                </p>

        <!-- Student scenarios -->
        <section>
            <h3>Social Engineering Scenarios Targeting Students</h3>

            <p>
                Here are common scenarios you might encounter as a university student:
            </p>

            <h4>Scenario 1: The "IT Department" Call</h4>
            <div class="warning-box">
                <p>
                    <strong>The Attack:</strong> You receive a call from someone claiming to
                    be from university IT. They say there's been a security breach and they
                    need your student ID number and password to "verify your account" and
                    "protect your data."
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>The Reality:</strong> IT departments never call students asking
                    for passwords. This is a classic pretexting attack.
                </p>
            </div>

            <h4>Scenario 2: The "Professor" Email</h4>
            <div class="warning-box">
                <p>
                    <strong>The Attack:</strong> An email apparently from your professor
                    asks you to purchase gift cards for a "class emergency" or "student
                    appreciation event." They'll reimburse you later.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>The Reality:</strong> Professors never ask students to purchase
                    gift cards. This is impersonation fraud.
                </p>
            </div>

            <h4>Scenario 3: The "New Student" Friend Request</h4>
            <div class="warning-box">
                <p>
                    <strong>The Attack:</strong> Someone claiming to be a new student sends
                    you a friend request and starts building a relationship. Eventually,
                    they ask for personal information or money for an "emergency."
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>The Reality:</strong> Romance scams and friendship fraud are
                    increasingly common on university campuses.
                </p>
            </div>

            <h4>Scenario 4: The "Free Textbook" Offer</h4>
            <div class="warning-box">
                <p>
                    <strong>The Attack:</strong> A website offers free PDF versions of
                    expensive textbooks if you create an account with your university
                    email and password.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>The Reality:</strong> The site harvests your university
                    credentials, potentially giving attackers access to your student
                    portal, email, and financial information.

            <h3>Protection Strategies</h3>

            <p>
                Defending against social engineering requires awareness and verification.
                Follow these practices:
            </p>

            <ol>
                <li>
                    <strong>Verify through official channels</strong> - If someone claims
                    to be from IT, your bank, or university administration, hang up and
                    call them back using the official number from the organization's website.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Never share passwords</strong> - No legitimate organization will
                    ever ask for your password via phone, email, or in person. This is a
                    non-negotiable rule.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Be skeptical of urgency</strong> - If someone pressures you to
                    act immediately, that's a red flag. Take time to verify the request
                    through independent channels.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Verify unexpected requests in person</strong> - If a "professor"
                    emails asking for something unusual, visit their office or call them
                    directly to confirm.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Protect physical access</strong> - Don't hold doors for strangers
                    at secure facilities. Politely direct them to the main entrance where
                    they can sign in properly.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Question gift card requests</strong> - Legitimate organizations
                    never ask for payment via gift cards. This is always a scam.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Limit social media exposure</strong> - Attackers gather personal
                    information from social media to make their pretexts more convincing.
                    Review your privacy settings.
                </li>
            </ol>

            <div class="success-box">
                <h4>The Verification Rule</h4>
                <p>
                    When in doubt, verify through a different channel. If you receive a
                    suspicious email, call the person directly. If you receive a suspicious
                    call, hang up and call the organization's official number. Legitimate
                    requests will withstand verification.

            <h3>What to Do If You're Targeted</h3>

            <p>
                If you suspect a social engineering attempt, take these steps:
            </p>

            <ol>
                <li>
                    <strong>Don't engage further</strong> - Stop the conversation and don't
                    provide any additional information.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Document the attempt</strong> - Save emails, note phone numbers,
                    and record what was said. This helps identify patterns and warn others.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Report to university IT</strong> - Your IT security team can
                    warn other students and potentially identify the attackers.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Change passwords if compromised</strong> - If you may have
                    revealed credentials, change them immediately and enable 2FA.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Warn others</strong> - Let classmates know about the attack so
                    they don't fall victim to the same tactics.
                </li>
