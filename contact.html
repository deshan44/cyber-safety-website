            <p>
                If you've experienced a cyberattack or believe your accounts have been
                compromised, take these immediate steps:
            </p>

            <ol>
                <li>
                    <strong>Change your passwords immediately</strong> - Start with your
                    email and any accounts that may be affected.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Enable 2FA</strong> - Add two-factor authentication to prevent
                    further unauthorized access.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Contact your university IT department</strong> - They can help
                    secure your academic accounts and may need to take action to protect
                    university systems.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Document everything</strong> - Save screenshots, emails, and
                    any other evidence of the attack.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Report to authorities</strong> - For serious incidents, file
                    a report with the appropriate agency (see links below).
                </li>
            </ol>

            <div class="warning-box">
                <h4>For Active/Urgent Incidents</h4>
                <p>
                    If you're experiencing an active attack or have already lost access
                    to accounts, contact your university IT department immediately by
                    phone rather than email. They can provide faster assistance and may
                    be able to help recover compromised accounts.

        <section>
            <h3>Frequently Asked Questions</h3>

            <h4>Can I report anonymously?</h4>
            <p>
                Yes. The name and email fields in our form are optional. You can also
                report to government agencies anonymously through their official channels.
            </p>

            <h4>What should I include when reporting a phishing email?</h4>
            <p>
                Include the sender's email address, subject line, and either forward
                the email or attach a screenshot. Note any links in the email (don't
                click them!) and describe what made you suspicious.
            </p>

            <h4>How quickly will I get a response?</h4>
            <p>
                We aim to respond to general inquiries within 2-3 business days. For
                urgent security incidents, please contact your university IT department
                directly for immediate assistance.
            </p>

            <h4>Can you help me recover a hacked account?</h4>
            <p>
                We can provide guidance, but account recovery typically needs to go
                through the service provider (Google, Microsoft, etc.) or your
                university IT department for academic accounts.
