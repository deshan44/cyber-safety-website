                    According to the Australian Cyber Security Centre (ACSC), the education

                    Students are particularly vulnerable due to multiple account management
                    and frequent use of shared networks.

            <h2>Three Things You Can Do Right Now</h2>

            <ol>
                <li>
                    <strong>Enable two-factor authentication (2FA)</strong> on your university
                    email and any accounts containing sensitive information. This blocks 99.9%
                    of automated attacks even if your password is compromised.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Audit your passwords</strong> - check if you're using the same
                    password on multiple accounts. Consider using a free password manager like
                    <a href="https://bitwarden.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bitwarden</a>
                    to generate and store unique passwords.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Learn to recognize phishing emails</strong> - visit our
                    <a href="phishing.html">Phishing Attacks page</a> to understand the warning
                    signs of fraudulent emails pretending to be from your university.
                </li>
            </ol>

            <div class="success-box">
                <h3>Taking these three steps significantly reduces your risk!</h3>
                <p>
                    Most cyberattacks rely on common vulnerabilities. By enabling 2FA, using
                    unique passwords, and recognizing phishing, you protect yourself from the
                    vast majority of threats targeting students.
